This project demonstrates an interactive *Pacman Factory*, where Pac-Men are dynamically created and move across the screen. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and can be used as a fun simulation to showcase object creation and movement within a web page.

## Features

- *Dynamic Pac-Man Creation*: Pac-Men are generated dynamically on the screen with a simple click.
- *Smooth Animation*: Pac-Men move across the screen smoothly, simulating the classic arcade game's movement.
- *Collision Detection*: The Pac-Men change direction upon hitting the edges of the screen, making the animation more interactive.
- *Randomized Behavior*: Each Pac-Man moves at a different speed and in a different direction for added variation.
